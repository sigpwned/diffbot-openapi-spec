# The verbatim OpenAPI spec has a couple of issues:
#
# * It uses version 3.1.0 of the OpenAPI standard, but tooling only supports 3.0.x
# * Its array items schema types use array instead of object (no idea why)
# * It has an incompletely-specified "/{api}" endpoint
#
# We use jq to clean these issues up.
#
# Also, we're only handling the "extract" OpenAPI spec at this time.
